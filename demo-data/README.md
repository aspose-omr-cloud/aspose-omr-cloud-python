# Aspose.OMR for Cloud

[Aspose.OMR for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/cloud) is a REST API that helps you to perform optical mark recognition in the cloud.
Developers can embed optical recognition in any type of application to extract data from images of tests, exams, questionnaires, surveys, etc. In the repository you can find examples on how to start using Aspose.OMR API in your project. 



## Contents

The repository contains data and configuration file that are used in OMR SDK's demo projects. Each platform SDK has such simple project that demonstrates main Aspose.OMR functionality.

## Installation
- Create your personal configuration file by copying [test_config_sample.json](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-demo-data/blob/master/test_config_sample.json "test_config_sample.json")  file under the name **test_config.json.**
- Edit this file providing your **app_key** and **app_sid** keys, which you can receive by registering at Aspose Cloud Dashboard (https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/) 
- **data_folder** value specifies relative path to the [Data](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-demo-data/tree/master/Data "Data") folder that contains files used to run OMR demos. You can leave default value if you follow repository structure and [Data](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-demo-data/tree/master/Data "Data") folder is located at the same level as **test_config.json.**
- We strongly recommend not to share **test_config.json** file and keep it out of source control, since it contains your credentials for working with Aspose Cloud products.
